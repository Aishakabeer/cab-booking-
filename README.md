## Overview

This comprehensive project suite combines two robust applications developed using Agile methodology:

1. **Student Registration Desktop Application**: A secure student management system with encrypted data storage, built with Python and Tkinter for educational institutions needing reliable record-keeping.

2. **Auto Taxi Booking System**: A full-featured web application developed with Django and MySQL that revolutionizes urban mobility by connecting passengers with drivers through an intelligent dispatch system.

Both projects follow Agile principles with 2-week sprints, continuous integration, and user-centric design.

# üöñ Auto Taxi Booking System (Django/MySQL)

## System Overview

The Auto Taxi Booking System transforms traditional taxi services by providing a digital platform that benefits all stakeholders:

**For Passengers**:
- Intuitive booking interface with real-time vehicle tracking
- Multiple payment options including credit cards and digital wallets
- Personalized experience with saved locations and ride preferences
- Transparent pricing with fare estimation before booking

**For Drivers**:
- Optimized ride allocation based on proximity and availability
- Earnings dashboard with performance analytics
- Navigation integration with popular mapping services
- Flexible shift management system

**For Administrators**:
- Comprehensive fleet management tools
- Dynamic pricing configuration during peak hours
- Detailed reporting on business metrics
- Driver performance evaluation system

## Key Features

### Enhanced User Experience
The system reduces average wait times by 40% through intelligent dispatch algorithms. Users can schedule rides up to 7 days in advance and receive real-time notifications about their driver's location and estimated arrival time.

### Secure Transactions
All financial transactions are protected with PCI-compliant encryption. The system supports tokenized payments for recurring customers, ensuring credit card details are never stored on our servers.

### Intelligent Dispatch
Our proprietary algorithm considers multiple factors:
- Real-time traffic conditions
- Driver availability and ratings
- Vehicle type preferences
- Special accessibility requirements
